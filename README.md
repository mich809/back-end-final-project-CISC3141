###  Overview
What are you building?
https://www.zoho.com/bugtracker/

#### Describe the bug tracker….
When a developer or a development team works on a project there are many instances when keeping track of bugs becomes difficult. A bug tracker will allow users to input information about the bugs found in their code allowing the user to track what needs to be done and keep a documentation of the process. The bug tracker will allow the user to create a bug tracker along with a description of what the bug is and update the bug tracker(whether that be changing the notes within the tracker or closing the tracker when the bug is fixed).
